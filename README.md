# Bayesian Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts Implementation Project

This is a project which aims to implement the algorithm presented in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2447. The goal is to implement this in full generality as a black box to be able to use this algorithm in the context of other machine learning problems.
